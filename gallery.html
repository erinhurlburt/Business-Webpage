    <p class="background">Where did we come from?</p>
    <p style="border: dotted white 2px; padding: 5px;">Our very first location was in New York, New York. Our goal there was to relax all the busy, stressed out business men and women. Our business boomed with all different types of CEOS, sales people, etc. Our found, Erin Hurlburt, started thinking about building a second Serenity Spa somewhere more beachy and tropical. That's when she decided to move to Maui, Hawaii and open another spa.</p>    

    <p class="background">What is our purpose?</p>
    <p style="border: dotted white 2px; padding: 5px">At Serenity Spa, our main purpose is all about relaxation and peace. We were built to serve all customers with a serene experience of their choice, whether is it a massage, facial, manicure, or all. Our founder decided she would create a spa for almost everything. She had alawys pictures the perfect spa to include anything you wanted. That is why here at Serenity Spa, we have all that you could imagine: a plethera of massages, facials, choices of nail polishes, two different relaxation pools, and stunning views of our calm ocean water. On October 23, 2018 we were fully built and instantly flooded with customers in need of a relaxed get-away day. Serenity Spa is the perfect place for any type of rexalation you need, all the way from muscle and pain relief massage to some relaxed alone time in our flower pools. We are always excited to treat and serve our guests and we hope you have a great day for unwinding at our spa!</p>
